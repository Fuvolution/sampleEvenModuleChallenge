                <h2>Purpose of this File:</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this file is to practice initializing a local directory and creating the connection with a newly 
                    created GitHub repository with the git remote add (GitHub-repository-HTTPS-URL) surrounded by angle brackets instead
                    of parenthesis! The point of doing this with this project is to practice the routine of creating the repository completely
                    from scratch that is required for me to do when starting any even-numbered module challenge assignments and any projects in 
                    the future! (Ex: Group Projects, Module 2 Challenge, Module 4 Challenge, Module 6 Challenge, etc.)
