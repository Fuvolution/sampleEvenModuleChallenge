# Sample Even Module Challenge

## Purpose
This project is my attempt to practice the routine of initializing a local directory as a local Git repository and connect it to this repository newly created in GitHub!
By doing this project, I am determining the steps I should take for whenever I start any even-numbered module challenge assignments where I need to create the repositories 
all from scratch!
